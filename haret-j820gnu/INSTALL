Welcome.

This is HaRET, the Handheld Reverse Engineering Tool. For a detailed description
see the files in the docs/ directory. This file documents how to build and
install it.

First, HaRET is a WinCE application, so get the arm-wince-pe
crosscompile toolchain as described here
https://trac.videolan.org/vlc/browser/trunk/INSTALL.wince
and install it.

Now type 'make'.
