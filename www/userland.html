<p align="justify">
Whereas the kernel is specific to the model,
most any Linux distribution for any ARM platform will work on
any other ARM platform that has sufficient memory and persistent storage.
</p><p align="justify">
You may have a look at userland distributions for other ARM devices:
the most promising project is
<a href="http://www.openembedded.org/oe_wiki/">OpenEmbedded</a>.

And if you have big enough a CF memory card (or a CF harddisk!),
you can even install <a href="http://www.debian.org/">debian-arm</a>
(e.g. bootstrapping from
<a href="http://pocketworkstation.org/">PocketWorkstation</a>)!

or see on <a href="http://handhelds.org/">handhelds.org</a>, etc.

Quick Tips:
<ul>
<li>If you lack space, you can do as I do:
mount stuff from the ramdisk and have a script create symlinks
to those few programs your CF provides
in addition to the minimal runtime from the ramdisk.
This way, I have XEmacs, zsh and GNU clisp on my CF,
plus all my personal files.
<li>If you have a bigger CF, you can save that precious RAM
and use <code>pivot_root</code> to chain into your favorite distribution.
The ramdisk provides hooks for that
and will even do a <code>pivot_root</code> automatically
if it detects the thing to be possible and unless you create
a file or directory <code>noautomount</code>.
Check the startup script <code>etc/functions</code> for details.
<li>You have to choose your distribution depending on the available CF space.
<li>If you're very tight, you might have to compile just the few programs
you need with the uclibc toolchain
(I have a 32MB CF with XEmacs and GNU clisp).
<li>If you want to run many programs, or big programs, then you'll need swap.
<li>If you have a linux workstation and a pcmcia network card for your j820,
 you can use the workstation as a NFS file server -- it works great for me.
<li>You may even use your linux workstation as a swap server using nbd
 (untested - send us feedback).
<li><code>chroot(2)</code> is your friend. Yes it is.
 However, note that you might need to mount a copy of
 <code>/proc</code>, <code>/dev/</code>, <code>/dev/pts</code>, etc.,
 under the point you chroot'ed.
<li>You can extract (on your NFS server or your CF)
an archive from
<a href="http://pocketworkstation.org/">PocketWorkstation</a>
or Oleg's <a href="old/oleg/TAR.bz2">tarfile</a>
as the basis for a debian installation.
<li>I installed debian that way on NFS,
and then copied the installation over to CF, excluding "non-necessary" files.
<li>You can make an ext2 partition either by using a CF reader on your
workstation, or by chrooting into NFS installation that has the ext2 tools.
<li>When hacking software packages on your Jornada820, you can use distcc
so as to delegate the compilation to a machine with more RAM and faster CPU.
<li>You might even be able to use qemu so as to cross-install your distribution
from a fast desktop computer with lots of RAM.
<li>You can also start from images designed for other ARM-based PDAs,
such as Zaurus, iPAQ, jornada720, etc.
<li>We're sorry not to have ready-packed solutions for your problem yet.

when you get something running!</em>
