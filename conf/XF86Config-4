# XF86Config-4 (XFree86 X Window System server configuration file)
#
# Jornada 820 message:
# This file was modified from the Debian default.
# Inserted was the display configuration, and serverflags.
# So as to get X working, you also need to do things from
# within your X initialization scripts.
# Insert these two lines in your .xinitrc and/or .xsession
# or whichever global script your X login system uses:
#	xterm +sb -geometry 1x1 -e sudo kbd_mode -k
#	xmodmap /etc/X11/Xmodmap.j820k
# You must have copied the Xmodmap.j820k to the right place
# and installed kbd_mode (from e.g. the Debian console-tools package).
# Also, don't forget to allow anyone to use kbd_mode with sudo
# (from the Debian sudo package) with this line in /etc/sudoers:
#	ALL	ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/kbd_mode
#
