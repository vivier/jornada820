Instructions for installing the Linux kernel on the HP Jornada 820.

<Step 0> - Prerequisites

* You need a CompactFlash card that fits into the Jornada's CF Type II slot.
 I (galmasi) use a small 32MB Sandisk.
 I (fare) use either a 8MB Sandisk or a gigabyte microdrive.
 Actually, if you have a NIC or if you're patient with your serial cable,
 you might be able to download the bootimage into RAM and boot from there.

* Since Linux will take over control of your RAM,
 you should backup any WinCE files and settings that you care to preserve,
 to CompactFlash or to a remote computer.
 Backups are always a good idea. At this time they are a *very* good idea.

* If you're downloading a binary bootimage from our site, jump to Step 5.

 Otherwise, you'll need a net-connected Linux workstation
 with an arm cross-compilation toolchain installed.
 Almost any toolchain should do - I (galmasi) use a homebrew one, but you
 should get the same results with the binaries downloaded from one of these:
	http://www.handhelds.org/z/wiki/Toolchains
	http://www.opensistemas.com/Gentoo_for_Zaurus.715.0.html
	http://www.openzaurus.org/official/toolchain/

<Step 1> - Get an appropriate kernel tree.

 method a) Check out current cvs.sf.net kernel:
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/jornada820 login
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/jornada820 checkout bootimage/linux/kernel
 The password is empty, just hit enter at the prompt.
 Note that we are reorganizing things on the CVS server, so in the meantime,
 you might have to use the old path and use the following to checkout instead:
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/jornada820 checkout kernel/linux/kernel

 method b) Check out current cvs.handhelds.org kernel and patch it.
	cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.handhelds.org:/cvs login
	cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@cvs.handhelds.org:/cvs checkout linux/kernel
 The password is "anoncvs", type it at the prompt (w/o quotes) and hit enter.
 Then download the latest patch from jornada820.sf.net and apply it:
	cd kernel && zcat ../path/to/patch.diff.gz | patch -p1 -E

 For more details about the handhelds CVS, see
	http://www.handhelds.org/sources.html
 You may also try to patch a kernel from a different provenance.
 If you try, we're interested in knowing whether or not you succeeded.

<Step 2> - Get an initial RAM disk image with which to boot your kernel.
 If you're a developer, you can get one from our private FTP site.
 Hopefully, by the time you read these instructions,
 we have released public images. Check our web site:
	http://jornada820.sourceforge.net/

 The initial ramdisk should be a pre-compiled root file system image
 for the ARM architecture. If you build your own kernel and ramdisk,
 make sure the kernel configuration includes support for the filesystem
 type used by your ramdisk (duh!).

<Step 3> - copy the configuration file and adjust to your liking.
 The default configuration file is in 
	arch/arm/def-configs/jornada820

 Copy it with
   cd kernel &&
   cp arch/arm/def-configs/jornada820 .config

 You can accept it as is with
	make oldconfig
 Or you can adjust it with
	make menuconfig
   or
	make xconfig

<Step 3> - Compile the kernel.

cd kernel &&
make ARCH=arm \
CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux- \
INITRD=/home/galmasi/jornadaport/ramdisk/ramdiskimage \
zImage j820

Replace the path for INITRD by the path to your ramdisk image from Step 2.

Note that ARCH=arm is not necessary if starting from our CVS release,
but might be necessary if starting from another kernel
(e.g. applying our patch to a generic kernel).

Similarly, the CROSS_COMPILE= statement might not be necessary
if you're using our CVS release whereas a toolchain is in your path.
Otherwise, you might have to specify the full path to your toolchain
as a prefix in statement such as CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/local/arm/3.3.1/bin/

What you end up with is the ELF binary kernel/arch/arm/boot/j820/j820.

<Step 4> - Boot.

Copy hpcboot.exe from NetBSD or our slightly modified version hpcbootl.exe,
together with j820 onto the CF card mentioned earlier,
and start hpcboot on the jornada.
Let it boot j820. You should get a prompt on the Jornada820 screen.
If you add the following to the kernel's command line: "console=ttySA0"
you will see the boot message on the serial port.

<Step 5> - Have FUN.

I'm sure you can figure out how to do it by yourself.
(For instance, you can have a lot of fun programming with ocaml or clisp.)

<Step 6> - Be done.

There is currently no way to shutdown and restart the computer from Linux.
To shutdown, you must unplug the computer and remove the main batteries.
If you have problems doing a warm reboot with WinCE,
then you must *also* remove the backup batteries in addition to the former,
which will completely clear off the RAM.
Then you can do a cold reboot of WinCE, and eventually launch Linux again.
Note: to skip the configuration utility launched by WinCE at cold reboots,
just kill it with Ctrl-Alt-Del. Aaaah!
