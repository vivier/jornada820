Build Environment for the Jornada 820 bootimage

The Makefile ought to contain everything you need to build the bootimage.
For hacking, an optional script "please" helps you do things
with the kernel tree.

------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------
make toolchain

create a toolchain to compile the bootimage.
All other targets assume that a toolchain is present.

The toolchain is based on uClibc - http://www.uclibc.org/
You may make it available in your PATH with
	ln -s ${TOPDIR}/gcc-3.3.x/toolchain_arm/bin/arm-linux-* /usr/local/bin/

Alternatively, you may reuse an existing ARM toolchain that you have installed.
You may notably find glibc-based toolchains on
	http://www.handhelds.org/z/wiki/Toolchains
	http://www.opensistemas.com/Gentoo_for_Zaurus.715.0.html
	http://www.openzaurus.org/official/toolchain/
But mind that glibc is both more bloated and less featureful
(the resolver doesn't work with static binaries).

Also note that you can put your toolchain to good use with distcc,
so as to speed up compilation on your Jornada.

make j820

create a bootimage based on the Linux 2.4 kernel.
Assumes that you have a working toolchain.

------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------
make j820-26

create a bootimage based on the Linux 2.6 kernel.
Assumes that you have a working toolchain.

NOTES

the current build system has glitches. Sorry for the inconvenience.
Please report them as you experience them. We will try to automate things,
and make the build process as seamless as affordable.

Sometimes, a target won't work at first, because some file didn't exist.
Sometimes, a target will do too much work at second, rebuilding stuff
that's already there.
Sometimes, a target will fail in a subtle way because old files got in the way.
