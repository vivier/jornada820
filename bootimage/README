BUILD ENVIRONMENT

The Makefile ought to contain everything you need to build the bootimage.
For hacking, an optional script "please" helps you do things
with the kernel tree.

------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------
make toolchain

create a toolchain to compile the bootimage.
All other targets assume that a toolchain is present.

The toolchain is based on uClibc - http://www.uclibc.org/
You may make it available in your PATH with
	ln -s ${TOPDIR}/gcc-3.3.x/toolchain_arm/bin/arm-linux-* /usr/local/bin/

Alternatively, you may reuse an existing ARM toolchain that you have installed.
You may notably find glibc-based toolchains on
	http://www.handhelds.org/z/wiki/Toolchains
	http://www.opensistemas.com/Gentoo_for_Zaurus.715.0.html
	http://www.openzaurus.org/official/toolchain/
But mind that glibc is both more bloated and less featureful
(the resolver doesn't work with static binaries).

Also note that you can put your toolchain to good use with distcc,
so as to speed up compilation on your Jornada.

make j820

create a bootimage based on the Linux 2.4 kernel.
Assumes that you have a working toolchain.
The Linux 2.4 kernel is rather stable and is usable as the basis for hacking.
It has been successfully used as an XEmacs-based editing machine
and as a debian-arm host.

------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------
make j820-26

create a bootimage based on the Linux 2.6 kernel.
Assumes that you have a working toolchain.
Note that the 2.6 kernel might not be usable right now.
Most importantly, it lacks pcmcia support as of the writing of this line.
See the TODO file.

BUILD ENVIRONMENT NOTES

The current build system may have glitches. We're sorry for the inconvenience.
Please report to us any bugs as you experience them.
We will try to automate things and make the build process
as seamless as affordable.

Kinds of bugs:
Sometimes, a target won't work at first, because some file didn't exist.
Sometimes, a target will do too much work at second,
rebuilding stuff that's already there.
Sometimes, a target will fail in a subtle way because old files got in the way.

RAMDISKIMAGE USAGE

The ramdisk that is built by this Makefile has the following usage:
* lots of functions are defined in /etc/functions -- see by yourself
* you may add your own additional functions in /etc/functions.local
* Use "standalone" to configure linux for standalone usage with the ramdisk.
* Use "rootfs" to chain-boot into your first Linux partition on CF.
* The ramdisk will automatically attempt to "rootfs" at startup, unless you
 create a file or directory named "noautomount" in your WinCE partition.
* We have mkfs.minix and fsck.minix in busybox. No ext2 support, sorry.
* Busybox is packed up with lots of functionality. Check it out!
* To free the memory occupied by the ramdisk, your rootfs will need to run
 the program blockdev, which is part of the util-linux debian package.

* With kernel 2.6, you must use cat /proc/modules instead of lsmod

------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------
RAMDISKIMAGE NOTES

* Building with a glibc toolchain will not only make everything much larger, it
 will also break the resolver functionality, that requires dynamic loading (!)

------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------>8------
KEYBOARD NOTES

* The top row keys are mapped to F1..F10, SysRq, Suspend.
