

THIS PROGRAM IS BASED ON LINEXEC.

here is how you use linexec:

To use linexec, you need 4 files.

linexec config file: params

Create a file called "params"

This params file specifies three lines of config for:
kernel image
initrd image
kernel args

For example, my params looks like this:
\My Documents\zimage
\My Documents\initrd.gz
init=/linuxrc keepinitrd root=/dev/rd/0


(This is what I actually have in my params file, but remember this might not
work for your kernel/device)

(Also a note for the params file, seems that the code is only happy if the
file is in unix format, i.e. newline as \r, but not dos format)

Pigeon.
